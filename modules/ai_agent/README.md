# ai-agent

Demonstrates how to create an [Amazon Bedrock Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html).This includes:

- A [Knowledge Base](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-kb-add.html) to enrich the base model with proprietary data
- [Action Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-action-create.html) for adding custom application behavior (as if the Agent could make internal API calls).

This will ulimately be consumed by [ai-app](https://github.com/ikenley/ai-app) on https://ai.ikenley.com/ai
